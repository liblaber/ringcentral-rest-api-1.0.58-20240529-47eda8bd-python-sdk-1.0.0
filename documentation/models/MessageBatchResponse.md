# MessageBatchResponse

Batch of A2P SMS messages. This object provides a specification to send message(s) to many recipients. It contains top-level attributes which apply to all messages. In addition to that, it is possible to override this attribute for each message. This way a single API call may be used to send individual messages to many recipients
