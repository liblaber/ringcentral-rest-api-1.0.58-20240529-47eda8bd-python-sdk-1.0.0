# AggregationResponseOptions

This field provides mapping of possible breakdown options for call aggregation and aggregation formula

**Properties**

| Name     | Type                               | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| :------- | :--------------------------------- | :------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| counters | AggregationResponseOptionsCounters | ❌       | The formula is defined by `aggregationType` and `aggregationInterval` for every counter individually. If `aggregationType` is `Sum` or `Percent`, `aggregationInterval` is not supported. If `aggregationType` is `Min`, `Max` or `Average`, `aggregationInterval` is required                                                                                  |
| timers   | AggregationResponseOptionsTimers   | ❌       | The formula is defined by `aggregationType` and `aggregationInterval` for every timer individually. If `aggregationType` is `Sum` or `Percent`, `aggregationInterval` is not supported. If `aggregationType` is `Min`, `Max` or `Average`, `aggregationInterval` is supported, but not required. If left empty, aggregation will be performed on per-call basis |
